# Hello World

This Solidity program is a "ERC20 TOKEN" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract of "ERC20" is in file named "ERC20.sol" and the contract of name
"Vault" is in file name "Vault.sol"


## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ERC20.sol,Vault.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

for ERC20.sol
```javascript

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract ERC20 {
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) public allowance;
    string public name = "Solidity by Example";
    string public symbol = "SOLBYEX";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;

		event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint value);

    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint amount
    ) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function mint(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
        emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), amount);
    }
}


```

```javascript

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

interface IERC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint);

    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint);

    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool);

    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint);

    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool);

    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint amount
    ) external returns (bool);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint value);
}

contract Vault {
    IERC20 public immutable token;

    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;

    constructor(address _token) {
        token = IERC20(_token);
    }

    function _mint(address _to, uint _shares) private {
        totalSupply += _shares;
        balanceOf[_to] += _shares;
    }

    function _burn(address _from, uint _shares) private {
        totalSupply -= _shares;
        balanceOf[_from] -= _shares;
    }

    function deposit(uint _amount) external {
        /*
        a = amount
        B = balance of token before deposit
        T = total supply
        s = shares to mint

        (T + s) / T = (a + B) / B 

        s = aT / B
        */
        uint shares;
        if (totalSupply == 0) {
            shares = _amount;
        } else {
            shares = (_amount * totalSupply) / token.balanceOf(address(this));
        }

        _mint(msg.sender, shares);
        // token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint _shares) external {
        /*
        a = amount
        B = balance of token before withdraw
        T = total supply
        s = shares to burn

        (T - s) / T = (B - a) / B 

        a = sB / T
        */
        uint amount = (_shares * token.balanceOf(address(this))) / totalSupply;
        _burn(msg.sender, _shares);
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}



```

also you need to deploy the custom subnet by following the given commands in terminal of your Linux Machine
```javascript

curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s


```

```javascript

export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH >> .bashrc

```

```javascript

avalanche subnet create mySubnet


```

and then

```javascript

avalanche subnet deploy mySubnet


```

you will get the rpc URL and your custom chain id which you have set, add these details in your Metamask and deploy your contract using injected provider using metamask on your custom subnet


Once your contract is deployed using our Subnet just test it with Remix Ide
